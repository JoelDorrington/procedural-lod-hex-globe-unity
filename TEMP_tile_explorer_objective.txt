Objective: Implement a Google Maps-style tile explorer for a planet terrain system.
- Zoom level and depth are interchangeable; zoom determines tile depth.
- At each zoom/depth, the ocean sphere surface is conceptually divided into square tile coordinates.
- Cast a few hundred rays from the camera to the sphere; hit locations determine which tiles to spawn.
- Run this heuristic ~30 times per second.
- Track tile instances to avoid duplicates and premature destruction.
- When zooming/changing depth, remove all old tiles and replace with tiles of the new depth on the next raycast pass.
