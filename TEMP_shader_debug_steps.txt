TEMP: Shader Debug Steps for Patchy Fade Investigation

1. In the shader, temporarily output only _Color.a as the fragment color to visualize the fade mask.
2. Output uv, normal, and worldPos as colors to see if there are discontinuities or ring patterns.
3. Check if any biome or gradient logic uses these values in a way that could cause artifacts.
